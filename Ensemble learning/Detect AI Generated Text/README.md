# Detect AI Generated Text - Kaggle Competition

This repository contains the script for the Kaggle competition Detect AI Generated Text. The goal of the competition is to build a machine learning model that can effectively distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text.

## Script: Using Ensemble Classifiers

The script for this competition is available here.

### Overview

The script uses ensemble learning techniques to improve the performance and robustness of the model. Ensemble methods combine several machine learning techniques into one predictive model to decrease variance, bias, and improve predictions.

### Requirements

To run the script, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy

### Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells.
